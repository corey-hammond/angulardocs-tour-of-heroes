# Angular Doc Tutorial - Tour of Heroes

### Create a New Workspace and Initial Application

```
ng new my-app-name
```

### Serve the Application

```
ng serve --open
```

### Make Changes to the Application

Use interpolation syntax {{ }} to present the component's property values inside the html template

```
<h1> {{ title }} </h1>
```

### Styles

Application-wide styles go in the src/styles.css file

### Generate a New Component

```
ng generate component component-name (heroes)
```
or ( ng g c heroes)

* The CLI generates the metadata properties in the component.ts file:
    1. selector - the component's CSS element selector
        * matches the name of the HTML element that identifies this component within a parent component's template
    2. templateURL - the location of the component's template file
    3. styleUrls - the location of the component's private CSS styles
* The ngOnInit() is a lifecycle hook. Angular calls ngOnInit() shortly after creating a component. It's a good place to put initialization logic.

### Show the New Component View

To display a component, you must add it to the template of the parent component using its element selector:
```
<app-heroes></app-heroes>
```

### Two-way Data Binding Syntax

```
<input [(ngModel)]="hero.name" placeholder="name" />
```

[(ngModel)] is Angular's two-way data binding syntax. Here it binds the hero.name property to the HTML input textbox so that data can flow in both directions: from the hero.name property to the textbox, and from the textbox back to the hero.name.

To use this, in app.module.ts import FormsModule from @angular/forms, and add FormsModule to the imports array.

### *ngFor

```
<li *ngFor="let hero of heroes"> {{hero.name}} </li>
```

Angular's repeater directive that repeats the host element for each element in a list.

1. <li> is the host element.
2. heroes holds the mock heroes list form the HeroesComponent.
3. hero holds the current hero object for each iteration through the list.

### Defining Private Styles

You define private styles either inline in the @Component.styles array or as a stylesheet file(s) identified in the @Component.styleUrls array.

```
@Component({
  selector: 'app-heroes',
  templateUrl: './heroes.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./heroes.component.css'] // This stylesheet affects this component only
})
```

### Click Event Binding

```
<li *ngFor="let hero of heroes" (click)="onSelect(hero)">
```

The parenthesis around CLICK tell Angular to listen for the <li> element's click event. When the user clicks in the <li>, Angular executes the onSelect(hero) expression. Define your click method in the component's class. 

### Use *ngIf to Hide Empty Details

``` 
<div *ngIf="selectedHero"> // Only show this div if there is a selectedHero 

  <h2>{{selectedHero.name | uppercase}} Details</h2>
  <div><span>id: </span>{{selectedHero.id}}</div>
  <div>
    <label>name:
      <input [(ngModel)]="selectedHero.name" placeholder="name"/>
    </label>
  </div>

</div>
```

### Class Binding

The Angular class binding makes it easy to add and remove a CSS class conditionally. Just add [class.some-css-class]="some-condition" to the element.

```
[class.selected]="hero === selectedHero" // Added to the <li> element
```

### Master/Detail Components

To make a child component's property available for binding by the external (parent) component, you must use the @Input decorator:

```
@Input hero: Hero; // In the child component
```

Bind the parent component's "selectedHero" property to the child component's "hero" property using property binding: 

```
<app-hero-detail [hero]="selectedHero"></app-hero-detail> // In parent component template
```

The child component will receive a hero object through its hero property and display it. This is a one-way data binding from the selectedHero property of the HeroesComponent to the hero property of the target element, which maps to the hero property of the HeroDetailComponent.

## Services

Components shouldn't fetch or save data directly, they should focus on presenting data and delegate data access to a service.

Create a new service:

```
ng generate service service-name
```

### @Injectable Services

The @Injectable decorator marks the class as one that participates in the "dependency injection system." It accepts a metadata object for the service the same way the @Component decorator does. 


In the service we will create a method to retrieve data. This can be from a web service, local storage, or a mock data source:

```
import { Hero } from './hero';
import { HEROES } from './mock-heroes'; // Mock data source

getHeroes(): Hero[] {
    return HEROES;
}
```

Import the service and inject it into any component that you want to be able to use the service:

```
import { HeroService } from '../hero.service';

constructor(private heroService: HeroService) { }
```

The parameter simultaneously defines a private heroService property and identifies it as a HeroService injection site. When Angular creates this component, the Dependency Injection system sets the heroService parameter to the singleton instance of the service. 

Now we can create a function in the component to retrieve the heroes from the service:

```
getHeroes(): void {
    this.heroes = this.heroService.getHeroes();
}
```

Now call the function in ngOnInit()

### Observables

HeroService.getHeroes() must have an asynchronous signature of some kind. In order to do this, we use the AngularHttpClient.get method to fetch data. HttpClient.get() returns an Observable, which is one of the key classes in the RxJS library. The syntax looks like this:

```
getHeroes(): Observable<Hero[]> {
    return HttpClient.get<Hero[]>()
}
```

The method used to return a Hero[], now it returns an Observable<Hero[]>. To account for this, in your component's method:

```
getHeroes(): void {
    this.heroService.getHeroes()
        .subscribe(heroes => this.heroes = heroes); // Subscribe is similar to .then()
}
```

The new version waits for the Observable to emit the array of heroesâ€”which could happen now or several minutes from now. The subscribe() method passes the emitted array to the callback, which sets the component's heroes property.

### Service-in-Service

In this project, we are creating a message component that displays app messages at the bottom of the screen. We create an injectable, app-wide message service for sending the messages to be displayed, and we will be injecting this service into the hero service to demonstrate a common service-in-service scenario. 

In the hero service constructor: 

```
constructor(private messageService: MessageService) { }
```

Since we will be binding the messageService property to the Message Component, we must inject it using the public keyword:

```
constructor(public messageService: MessageService) { } // In the MessagesComponent class
```
